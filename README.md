# Speech Recognition and Text-to-Speech with ChatGPT

This Python project utilizes OpenAI's ChatGPT, speech recognition, and pyttsx3 modules to create a speech-enabled AI chatbot. Users can speak into a microphone, and the AI model will recognize the speech, generate a response, and convert it into spoken text using text-to-speech functionality.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, you need to have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- OpenAI Python library
- SpeechRecognition library
- pyttsx3 library

You will also need an OpenAI API key to access the ChatGPT model. Make sure to set up your API key as an environment variable or configure it within the code.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/Git-Utkarsh/JarvisChatGPT.git
